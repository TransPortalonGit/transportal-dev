# What is transportal?

TransPortal is the online portal of the fabrication laboratory (FabLab) in the University of Bremen. It provides for various web applications, which assist and carry the social and organizational aspects of the FabLab (e.g. documentation of projects, inventory system, ..., etc.)

# Technical details

TransPortal has been developed using Laravel 4.2 (PHP 5.3+ framework), HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

# Quick history

TransPortal began as a "Master Project" for the MSc. Digital Media program at the University of Bremen. It was conceived, designed and implemented within a semester (6 months) by Raskmey Meas, Simon Engelbertz, Stefanos-Rafail Trialonis, and Xiaofen Peng. None of the students previously had any firm technical experience related to web development. The project changed hands the next semester, where a group of Bachelor students from the same program (namely: Alex Antoni, Julian Berndt, Victoria Ivleva, Steven Kowalzik, Philip Leder, Rieke Leder, Majid Mehrafza, Debbie Reineke, Carolin Rottmann, Florian Saade, Gian-Luca Savino, Maria Soliman, Arthur Stricker, Marc Tim Thiemann, Ben Thitigal, Kristopher Will, Arzu Yumusak, Luselia Zelada Lopez) used TransPortal as a basis for implementing more plug-ins and modules.

# Current status

At the moment, the platform is being maintained and further developed by Stefanos-Rafail Trialonis. Contributions of all sorts are welcome.
